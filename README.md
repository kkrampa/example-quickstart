# IceCI quickstart Python example 

This repository is a small example to help you get started with the **IceCI** quickstart guide. It contains a very simple pipeline, just to show the structure of the `.iceci.yaml` file.

This repository is a *GitHub template repository*, so please feel free to create new repositories based on it and mess around with the code and the pipeline config. For more info and reference please check the [documentation](https://iceci.readthedocs.io/)
